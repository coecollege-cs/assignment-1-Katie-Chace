# Questions for Customer

## Payroll in their Company
Do they have salaried workers, hourly workers, pieceworkers, or some combination?
Do employees turn in time sheets, or do they mark when they come in and leave on a time sheet that the managers then put into the system?

## Who's going to use the software?
Will employees use it? Managers? Just people assigned to payroll?

## Software Functions
Will it need to consider taxes?
Will it manage employee benefits such as health insurance and paid sick days and vacation days?
Should the software tell the banks to pay the employees, or give a list of the information so a payroll employee can handle that aspect?

## Software Inputs
Does the customer want to provide a list of the pay rates for each employee, or each type of employee, or just have that information on every time sheet?
